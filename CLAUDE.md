# Notes for working in this repo

Context for anyone (human or agent) editing this pipeline. The README covers
what it does and how to run it; this file covers what will bite you.

## master.py is generated — never edit it

`master.py` is 6,300 lines assembled from `modules/*.py` by `build_master.py`.
Edit the module, run `python build_master.py`, commit both. A change made
directly in `master.py` is destroyed by the next build.

`git status` immediately after a build is the sync check: clean means
`master.py` matches the modules.

## The build makes surgical assumptions about module structure

`build_master.py` locates things by pattern, not by parsing. Every module must
keep:

- a leading `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` line followed immediately by the module
  docstring (the docstring strip anchors on it),
- an `# INSTALLATION` block ending with the literal `print("✅  All packages present")`,
- a `# RUN & PREVIEW` block at the bottom, wrapped in `if __name__ == "__main__":`,
- its config global named exactly `CONFIG`.

The build asserts all four before and after stripping and exits with
`BUILD FAILED: …` rather than emitting a wrong `master.py`. If you restructure
a module header, expect to update `build_master.py` in the same commit.

## Name collisions are handled by hand

Concatenating four standalone modules means duplicate top-level names, and
Python just lets the last definition win. `build_master.py` renames the known
ones via `word_replace()`:

| Module | Renames |
|--------|---------|
| catalog | `CONFIG`→`CATALOG_CONFIG`, `build_catalog`→`build_asteroid_catalog`, `lookup_asteroid`→`lookup_asteroid_catalog` |
| mineral_value | `CONFIG`→`MINERAL_CONFIG`, `merge_sources`→`merge_mineral_sources`, `validate`→`validate_minerals` |
| transportation | `CONFIG`→`TRANSPORT_CONFIG`, `validate`→`validate_transport` |
| calc | `CONFIG`→`CALC_CONFIG` |

`lookup_asteroid` is the cautionary tale: modules 1 and 4 both defined it, they
are different functions over different frames, and module 4's silently won —
while module 1's help text still told you to call it. Fixed in `91f2763`.

The post-build AST scan catches new collisions. Do not ignore its warning;
either add a rename or, if the duplication really is deliberate and identical
in every copy, add the name to `_EXPECTED_DUPES`.

## Bump `pipeline_version` when output changes

Each module carries a `pipeline_version` in its config dataclass, and it is
stamped into every output CSV. That stamp is the only way to tell which code
produced a given catalog, so changing any number a run produces means bumping
it. The version-history comment block above each `pipeline_version` field is
the real changelog for this project — it records the numerical impact of each
change, often hand-verified. Add to it, don't replace it.

This has already failed once: the project was briefly developed in two places
at once, and `1.0.6` / `1.1.4` / `1.3.6` each shipped as two different things.
See the README's "parallel-repo divergence" section — CSVs stamped with those
versions cannot be trusted and should be regenerated.

Current: catalog `1.0.8`, mineral_value `1.4.0`, transportation `1.5.0`,
calc `1.6.0`, master `1.7.0` (the master version is a literal in
`build_master.py`'s `MASTER_HEADER` and `MASTER_ORCHESTRATOR` — two places).

## Model assumptions that are load-bearing

These were found by a realism audit and are easy to silently break again.

**`delivery_destination` must be set in TWO places, and they must agree.**
`MINERAL_CONFIG.delivery_destination` decides what a kilogram sells for;
`CALC_CONFIG.delivery_destination` decides the architecture that puts it
there. Disagreement prices the cargo at a depot while paying to land it in
Utah — Stage 4's `destination_check()` catches it and shouts, and in
`master.py` use `MASTER_CONFIG.delivery_destination`, which writes both.

**Every commodity is priced by destination, not just water** (Stage 2
v1.3.0). At an in-space destination the terrestrial price is *replaced* by
`in_space_utility × launch-cost-avoided`. Two consequences that look wrong
but are not: bulk iron jumps from $0.50/kg to ~$2,977/kg in LEO, and
platinum drops to **zero**, because there is no orbital market for it. The
in-space prices are derived through the rocket equation in
`delivered_cost_usd_per_kg()`, not tabulated — but `IN_SPACE_UTILITY` is a
table of *engineering judgements*, and it is the softest assumption in the
whole pipeline. Treat it as a dial, not a measurement.

**Cislunar is cheaper to reach than LEO, and worth more.** This is the one
result that reliably reads as a bug. Capturing into LEO has to kill the
entire arrival hyperbola (~3.6 km/s at v_inf = 3 km/s); capturing into an
NRHO depot only has to *bind* the orbit, and the burn takes the Oberth
benefit at low perigee (~0.94 km/s). See `_cislunar_capture_dv_km_s`. Do not
"fix" it.

**Mars is a separate heliocentric transfer, not a scaled Earth return.**
`_asteroid_to_mars_dv_km_s` terminates the transfer ellipse at 1.524 AU and
captures into Mars' well. Approximating it off the Earth legs would erase the
whole point: a main-belt body is cheaper to deliver to Mars (3.84 km/s) than
to Earth (4.13). Mars has an atmosphere so aerocapture applies and TPS is
carried; the Moon does not, so `lunar_surface` ignores
`use_aerocapture_return` exactly as `cislunar` does.

**Surface delivery costs are chained per stage, not lumped.** Module 2's
`_DELIVERY_LEGS` walks real stages backwards from the payload. Collapsing the
lunar chain into one 5,920 m/s burn would overstate the Moon by ~2x (10.96 vs
4.99 kg in LEO per kg landed) because it throws away staging. Mars' `edl` leg
carries a measured surviving-mass fraction (MSL 27.6%, Perseverance 29.8%),
not a Delta-v.

**The two surface prices are marginal-transport LOWER BOUNDS.** No NRE, no
programme overhead, no cadence limit, on a reusable Falcon 9 LEO price. Real
CLPS lunar delivery is ~$1M/kg today at ~100 kg scale against this model's
$21,210/kg. They answer "what could this cost at industrial scale", and the
whole Mars result rests on that framing.

**A commodity with no in-space market is not worth zero at a depot.** It is
worth its terrestrial price *minus* the downleg (`downleg_cost_usd_per_kg` —
capsule + TPS + recovery + departure burn, ~$25,400/kg from LEO). Platinum at
a depot is ~$31,300/kg, not $0. Conversely, launch-cost-avoided is **additive**
to the terrestrial price, not a replacement for it. `value_route` records
which fate each commodity took.

**The payload mix is optimised, not specified.** `optimal_payload_mix` is a
fractional knapsack over `asteroid_phase_table` — fill the hold with the best
phase available, then the next. Greedy by $/kg is provably optimal here
because the phases are divisible and priced per kg. Both bounds (content and
purity) fall out of it; do not reintroduce them as separate clamps.

**How hard to concentrate is searched, not derived.** Grade saturates at
`saturation_ratio` = 1/(frac_best × recovery); costs keep climbing. So the
optimum is usually strictly interior and `evaluate_combo` sweeps for it. Two
mistakes already made here, both of which *looked* principled:
  1. Driving the ratio to the maximum — made cislunar missions 4× worse.
  2. Driving it to saturation on principle — still made cislunar ~12% worse.
The search also always evaluates **not concentrating at all** (via
`beneficiate=False`), which is not the same as ratio 1.0 — that would still
pay the separation recovery loss and the array mass for no grade gain.
Without that baseline beneficiation cannot be declined, and stops being
weakly dominant.

Note this makes the beneficiation path ~10× slower (~5 s → ~55 s per 1,959
asteroids). `concentration_search_steps` is the dial.

**The beneficiation power plant feeds back into the rocket equation.**
Processing energy (Module 3: 200 Wh/kg dug, 500 Wh/kg concentrated) over the
stay time gives a power draw; Module 3's 60 W/kg-at-1-AU row scaled 1/r² by
the target's semi-major axis turns that into array mass; the array is
launched like everything else. Payload → feed → power → mass → payload is a
genuine circular dependency and `evaluate_combo` solves it by fixed-point
iteration. The 1/r² term is why a 3+ AU target needs a ~54× heavier plant
than a 1 AU one.

**Δv must stay per-asteroid.** Before v1.4.0 every asteroid got the same Δv,
which made `max_payload_kg`, `total_cost_usd`, `mission_duration_yr`, `vehicle`
and `propellant` single-valued across an entire catalog — the ranking was
composition-only and accessibility had no effect. If you ever see those
columns collapse to one unique value again, `use_per_asteroid_dv` is off or
the orbital elements aren't reaching Stage 4.

**Electric propulsion needs its Δv penalty.** The rocket equation ignores
thrust; trajectories don't. Without `dv_penalty_factor`, a 3,000 s Isp
thruster wins the mass cascade on an impulsive budget it cannot fly.

**Extraction is rate-limited.** Payload is capped by what the rig can dig
inside `max_mining_duration_yr`, and the dig time feeds mission duration, ops
cost and WACC. Removing that cap makes the rig an infinitely fast vacuum.

**M-type is not a bare metal core.** No M-type has ever been measured near
iron-meteorite density — Psyche is ~3.8–3.9 g/cm³. Metal fractions are set
accordingly; don't restore the 0.80/5.30 values.

A default run produces zero viable missions. That is the correct answer, not
a regression. So does every other combination currently in the model — the
best case found so far (cislunar delivery) still comes in at ~51× cost over
revenue, down from ~297,000× at the `earth_surface` default. Beneficiation
halves the *median* gap but does not move the best target, where the
optimiser declines to concentrate.
Closing that last 51× is not a tuning exercise; the remaining candidates are
a learning curve on recurring hardware, multi-mission amortisation against a
market-saturation limit that does not yet exist in the model, and rig
terminal value. Do not manufacture viability by editing `IN_SPACE_UTILITY`.

Rank by `total_cost_usd / gross_value_usd`, not by `profit_usd`. Revenue is
orders of magnitude below cost in most configurations, which makes
`profit_usd ≈ -total_cost_usd`, so `top_profitable()` degenerates into a
pure cost ranking — a Δv table wearing a profit label. The ratio is the only
ranking that responds to both sides.

## Config discipline

Configs are dataclasses instantiated once at module scope. Edit the field
default *inside* the dataclass, not the instance afterwards — mutating
`CONFIG.foo` after construction defeats having one editable source of truth,
and every module says so in a comment.

## Correctness invariants that were expensive to find

Undoing any of these silently corrupts the output:

- **Designation extraction** must not use a naive `^\d+` regex. For
  `"2024 BX1"` that yields `"2024"`, which cross-matches unrelated bodies.
  See `_extract_canonical_designation` in `catalog.py`.
- **`str.contains` needs `regex=False`** in every lookup helper. Designations
  and mineral names carry regex metacharacters, so `"(1) Ceres"` matched
  `"1 Ceres"` and unbalanced brackets raised `re.PatternError`.
- **TPS mass belongs inside the rocket-equation cascade**, not just in the
  cost model. It is hauled outbound as dead mass and pushed back through the
  return burn. Omitting it overstates max payload by ~30%.
- **The return-capsule volume cap must bind**, not merely be reported. It is
  the only constraint keeping the mission physical when ISRU is on and
  aerocapture is off.
- **Composition fractions sum to 0.76–0.96**, not 1.0. The residual is valued
  at a bulk-silicate floor rather than zero.
- Do not globally suppress warnings in `catalog.py` — real `RuntimeWarning`s
  (divide-by-zero in the derived physical columns) need to stay visible.

## Data sources fail softly by design

Unreachable or empty sources are tolerated and the run continues. MP3C is
regularly DNS-blocked from Colab. Do not "fix" an empty source by flipping its
toggle off — the toggle is for deliberately excluding a source, not for
routing around an outage.

`metals.dev` defaults to the key `"DEMO"`, which makes the fetcher skip
entirely. That is intentional; the demo endpoint is heavily rate-limited.

## Google Drive makes the tree look dirty — run the hooks

Symptom: `git status` reports files as modified, `git diff` shows nothing,
and every blob hash matches. Then `git checkout` or `git merge --ff-only`
aborts with *"your local changes would be overwritten"*, so a merged PR
silently fails to land locally. This bit twice before it was diagnosed.

Cause: Drive File Stream reports a **placeholder size of 16384 bytes** when
git stats a file right after writing it during checkout. Git caches that in
the index stat:

```
git ls-files --debug master.py   ->  size: 16384
ls -l master.py                  ->  328335
```

Every later `status` sees the mismatch and reports modified *without reading
the file* — a differing size is normally conclusive proof of a change. That is
exactly why `diff` and `status` disagree, and why
`git update-index --refresh` refuses to fix it.

It is **not** a stat-metadata problem. `core.checkStat=minimal`,
`core.trustctime=false` and `core.fscache=false` were each tried and none of
them help; don't re-add them.

Fix: `.githooks/drive-restat.sh` re-stats entries whose content already
matches the index, wired to `post-checkout`, `post-merge` and `post-rewrite`.
A fresh clone must opt in once:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Run it by hand any time the tree looks wrong:

```bash
sh .githooks/drive-restat.sh
```

It only touches files whose hash already equals the index blob, so it cannot
stage, hide, or discard a real edit. If things are badly tangled, the
heavier reset is to delete the index and rebuild it — safe when the working
tree already matches HEAD, and it discards staging only:

```bash
rm -f "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/index" && git reset
```

A checkout that moves *back* to a commit predating the hooks deletes them
mid-checkout, so they can't run — repair by hand afterwards.

## Environment

Windows, Python 3.13, invoked as `py` (a bare `python` hits the Microsoft Store
alias and fails). The working tree is on Google Drive with the git directory
outside it — see the README's "Working copy" section, especially if the folder
gets renamed again.
